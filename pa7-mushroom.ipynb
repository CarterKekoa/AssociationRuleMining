    "\n",
    "For this dataset, you will want to do feature selection (because of the number of attributes). Try using different subsets of features (though always include the class feature) and report on the effect of the rules generated and the performance in terms of the time it takes for your implementation to find the rules. You can measure execution time using the time Python standard library, which has a time() function you can use to find the elapsed execution time. Alternatively, you can use the %time or %timeit IPython magic commands to measure the time it takes to run a line (called line magic, %) or a cell (called cell magic %%) in a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
